<h2> all you need is to belive in yourself </h2> 

<p> 
You can't skip chapters, that's not how life works.</br> 
You have to read every line, meet every character.</br> 
You won't enjoy all of it. some chapters will make you cry for weeks.</br> 
You will read things you don't want to read, you will have moments when you don't want the pages to end.</br>
But you have to keep going. Stories keep the world revolving. </br> 
Live yours, don't miss out.
